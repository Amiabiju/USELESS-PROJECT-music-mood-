# MUSIC MOOD 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Code Crusaders

### Project Description
Music Mood is a playful, pre-programmed website where users select their current mood — like Happy, Sad, Calm, Energetic, or Relaxed — and instantly receive the same meme song no matter the mood chosen by the user and an handpicked image that fits the vibe.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Spotify too hard for lazy people!! Too many options to choose😭

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Emotions are hard. Click a button, cry to royalty-free audio. 😭🎶
